## 🖥️ Web Interface

The Media Processor includes a modern web interface for easy control and monitoring:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dn9gYQn.png" alt="Media Processor Dashboard" width="45%">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/J9ETYtO.png" alt="Media Processor Settings" width="45%">
</p>

### Features:
* **📊 Dashboard** - View processing statistics and current status with real-time updates
* **🎛️ Controls** - Start, stop, and restart the processor with visual feedback
* **⚙️ Settings** - Configure SMB connections and media paths with validation
* **📋 Logs** - View real-time processing logs with auto-refresh
* **🔧 Diagnostics** - Test connections and troubleshoot issues
* **📁 Persistent History** - File processing history is saved and persists across system restarts
* **✨ Modern UI** - Glassmorphism design with responsive layout

Access the web interface at: `http://your-server:3005`

### Service Architecture

The Media Processor system consists of two separate services:

1. **`media-processor.service`**: Runs the actual media processing scripts
2. **`media-processor-ui.service`**: Serves the web interface and API on port 3005

> **Note**: To permanently update the systemd service to use port 3005, run:
> ```bash
> sudo ./update-port.sh
> ```
> This script updates the service file and restarts the service with the new port configuration.

Important notes about service management:

* The "Restart" button in the web interface only restarts the `media-processor.service`
* If you make changes to the web interface code, you need to restart the web service separately:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart media-processor-ui.service
  ```
* When troubleshooting, you may need to restart both services:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart media-processor-py.service
  sudo systemctl restart media-processor-ui.service
  ```

### Service Logs

To view service logs for troubleshooting:
```bash
# Media processor logs (primary service)
journalctl -u media-processor-py.service -f

# Web interface logs
journalctl -u media-processor-ui.service -f

# Alternative commands for continuous monitoring
sudo journalctl -f -u media-processor-py.service
sudo journalctl -f -u media-processor-ui.service
```

## 🔧 Configuration

**✨ New Unified Configuration System**: All components now use a single `.env` file for consistent configuration across bash, Python, and Node.js!

Edit `.env` in the project root to customize your setup:

```bash
# Source directory - where JDownloader saves files
SOURCE_DIR="/path/to/your/downloads/"

# Logging configuration
LOG_FILE="/path/to/media-processor.log"
LOG_LEVEL="info"

# SMB connection settings
SMB_SERVER="your-nas-server.local"
SMB_SHARE="your-share-name"
SMB_USERNAME="your-username"
SMB_PASSWORD="your-password"
SMB_DOMAIN=""

# Media paths - relative to SMB share root
MALAYALAM_MOVIE_PATH="media/malayalam movies"
MALAYALAM_TV_PATH="media/malayalam-tv-shows"
ENGLISH_MOVIE_PATH="media/movies"
ENGLISH_TV_PATH="media/tv-shows"

# Language extraction settings
EXTRACT_AUDIO_TRACKS=true
EXTRACT_SUBTITLES=true
PREFERRED_LANGUAGE="mal"
PREFERRED_AUDIO_LANGS="mal,eng"
PREFERRED_SUBTITLE_LANGS="eng"

# Processing options
DRY_RUN=false
CLEAN_ORIGINAL_FILES=true
CLEANUP_RAR_FILES=true

# Service ports
PORT=3005
PYTHON_API_PORT=5001
```

### Configuration Benefits:
- **🎯 Single Source of Truth**: All components read from the same `.env` file
- **🔒 Enhanced Security**: Credentials centralized in one secure location
- **🔧 Easy Maintenance**: Update settings in one place, affects all components
- **⚡ Backward Compatible**: Legacy `lib/config.sh` still works as a fallback

```bash
./bin/media-processor.sh --process /path/to/file.mkv
```

### Dry Run Mode

Test without making any changes:

```bash
DRY_RUN=true ./bin/media-processor.sh
```

### Debugging

Enable verbose logging:

```bash
DEBUG=true ./bin/media-processor.sh
```
